# 🚨 Production Critical Fixes

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocking Production Deployment

---

## 🐛 **Issues Identified**

### **Issue 1: User Creation Fails**
**Error:** `NOT NULL constraint failed: users.password_hash`

**Problem:**
- When "User will set their password" is selected
- `password_hash` is set to `None`
- Database has NOT NULL constraint

**Impact:** Cannot create new users for production

---

### **Issue 2: Interview Scheduling Shows "Coming Soon"**
**Problem:**
- Interview scheduling API exists (Phase 3)
- But UI still shows "coming soon" message
- Not integrated into candidate detail page

**Impact:** Cannot schedule interviews in production

---

### **Issue 3: User Edit Functionality Missing**
**Problem:**
- Edit button shows "coming soon" message
- Cannot edit existing users
- Cannot change passwords

**Impact:** Cannot manage users in production

---

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: User Creation Password Hash** ✅

**File:** `services/user_management_service.py`

**Change:**
```python
# Before (❌ Fails)
else:
    activation_token = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
    password_hash = None  # ❌ NOT NULL constraint fails

# After (✅ Works)
else:
    activation_token = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
    # Use a placeholder password hash that cannot be used for login
    password_hash = self.password_service.hash_password(f"UNSET_{secrets.token_urlsafe(32)}")
```

**Result:**
- ✅ User creation works
- ✅ Placeholder password cannot be used for login
- ✅ User must set password via activation link

## 🎯 **Priority**

**CRITICAL for production deployment:**
1. ✅ **User Creation** - FIXED
2. 🔄 **Interview Scheduling** - IN PROGRESS
3. 🔄 **User Edit** - IN PROGRESS

**Without these fixes, cannot:**
- Create new users for the team
- Schedule interviews with candidates
- Manage existing users

---

## 📝 **Notes**

### **User Creation:**
- Now uses placeholder password when "User will set password"
- Placeholder format: `UNSET_{random_token}`
- Cannot be used for login
- User must activate account and set password

### **Interview Scheduling:**
- API already exists from Phase 3
- Just needs UI integration
- Supports conflict detection
- Supports multiple interviewers

### **User Edit:**
- Update endpoint already exists
- Just needs UI modal
- Supports role changes
- Supports password changes
