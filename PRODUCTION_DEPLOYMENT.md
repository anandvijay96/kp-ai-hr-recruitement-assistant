## 🔍 **Production Logs to Check:**

After deployment, check Dokploy logs for:

```
INFO:api.v1.vetting:📝 Extracted candidate data: Name=None, Email=..., Phone=...
INFO:api.v1.vetting:🔄 Attempting to extract name from filename: ...
INFO:api.v1.vetting:   After cleanup: Natikala Shiva Shankar
INFO:api.v1.vetting:✅ Using name from filename: Natikala Shiva Shankar
INFO:services.resume_analyzer:Using Selenium for LinkedIn verification: Natikala Shiva Shankar

```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

### **Chrome/Chromium Requirement:**
- Selenium requires Chrome or Chromium browser
- Should already be installed in Dokploy Docker image
- If not, add to Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y chromium-browser
  ```

### **Network Access:**
- DuckDuckGo must be accessible from server
- No CAPTCHA challenges (DuckDuckGo is CAPTCHA-free)
- Rate limits are generous

### **Performance:**
- Each LinkedIn verification adds ~3-5 seconds per resume
- Runs in background, doesn't block UI
- Results cached in scan session
