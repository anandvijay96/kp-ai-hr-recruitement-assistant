**📅 Last Updated:** October 15, 2025 - 1:10 AM IST  
**🎯 Branch:** mvp-1  
**📊 Progress:** 75% Complete (Manual Rating System Complete)  
**🚀 Next Milestone:** HR Team Demo (Oct 25, 2025)

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS**

### **Issue 1: Admin User Creation** ⚠️ URGENT
**Problem:** New registrations default to "Recruiter" role. No way to create admin users from UI.

**Solution Provided:**
- ✅ Created `create_production_admin.py` - Create new admin user
- ✅ Created `make_user_admin.py` - Promote existing user to admin

**Usage:**
```bash
# Option 1: Create new admin user
python create_production_admin.py admin@company.com SecurePass123! "Admin Name"

# Option 2: Promote existing user to admin
python make_user_admin.py existing@company.com
```

**For Production (Dokploy):**
```bash
# SSH into container or use Dokploy console
docker exec -it <container_name> python make_user_admin.py your@email.com
```

    user = get_current_user(request)  # From session
    return templates.TemplateResponse("profile.html", {
        "request": request,
        "user": user,
        "page": "profile"
    })

# API endpoint
@router.post("/api/v1/profile/update")
async def update_profile(data: ProfileUpdate):
    # Update user profile
    # Return success/error
```

**Settings Page (`/settings`):**
```python
# Route
@router.get("/settings")
async def settings_page(request: Request):
    user = get_current_user(request)
    preferences = await get_user_preferences(user.id)
    return templates.TemplateResponse("settings.html", {

    client = relationship("Client", back_populates="jobs")

# In candidate management
class Candidate(Base):
    # ... existing fields
    vendor_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("vendors.id"), nullable=True)
    vendor = relationship("Vendor", back_populates="candidates")
```

- Only approved resumes go to database
- Session expires after 1 hour

**JD Matching:**
- Uses `JDMatcher` service
- Method: `match_resume_with_jd(resume_text, jd_text)`
- Returns: skills_match, experience_match, education_match, overall_match
- Results displayed in vet_resumes and upload pages

**Document Processing:**
- Supports PDF, DOC, DOCX
- Uses PyPDF2 + python-docx + Tesseract OCR
- Extracts text, structure, metadata
- Enhanced extractor has 95%+ accuracy

**Current Progress:** 70% (3/5 P0 features complete)

**Ready for Demo:** Almost! Need:
1. Manual Rating System (2-3 days)
2. Search completion (1-2 days)
3. Driver.js tutorial (1 day)
4. Testing & polish (1 day)

**Total Time to Demo:** 5-7 days

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Core features are solid, just need finishing touches

**Recommendation:** Focus on P0 features first, add nice-to-haves (Profile, Settings, Client/Vendor) only if time permits.
