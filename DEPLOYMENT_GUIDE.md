# 🚀 Production Deployment Guide - MVP-2 to MVP-1

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Branch:** mvp-2 → mvp-1  
**Deployment Platform:** Dokploy (PostgreSQL)

---

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

All features tested and ready:
- ✅ Navbar access for recruiters/managers
- ✅ Soft delete with user tracking
- ✅ Hard delete (admin only)
- ✅ Admin deleted candidates UI
- ✅ Activity dashboard with real-time charts
- ✅ Bootstrap toasts (no alerts)
- ✅ Auto-reload after restore/delete
- ✅ SQLite WAL mode (for local dev)

---

## 📋 Step 1: Merge to MVP-1 Branch

```bash
# Switch to mvp-1 branch
git checkout mvp-1

# Merge mvp-2 into mvp-1
git merge mvp-2

# Push to trigger Dokploy deployment
git push origin mvp-1
```

**Dokploy will automatically:**
1. Detect the push to mvp-1
2. Pull latest code
3. Build Docker container
4. Deploy to production
5. Restart application

---

## 🗄️ Step 2: Database Migration (REQUIRED)

### **Migration Script:** `migrations/add_soft_delete_columns.py`

**SSH into your Dokploy server and run:**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/deployed/app

# Run migration
python migrations/add_soft_delete_columns.py
```

**Columns Added to `candidates` table:**
- `is_deleted` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE, indexed)
- `deleted_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- `deleted_by` (VARCHAR(255))
- `deletion_reason` (TEXT)

**Expected Output:**
```
🔄 Starting migration: Add soft delete columns to candidates table
  ➕ Adding column: is_deleted
  ➕ Adding column: deleted_at
  ➕ Adding column: deleted_by
  ➕ Adding column: deletion_reason
  ✓ Created index on is_deleted
✅ Migration completed successfully!
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This migration is **safe** - it only adds columns, doesn't modify existing data.

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Environment Variables (No Changes Needed)

Your existing `.env` file should work as-is:

```env
# Database (PostgreSQL on Dokploy)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:5432/dbname

# Other existing variables
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
# ... etc
```

**No changes required!** The code automatically detects PostgreSQL and uses appropriate settings.

## 🐘 PostgreSQL vs SQLite - Concurrency Comparison

### **Your Question: Will PostgreSQL handle concurrent usage smoothly?**

**Answer: YES! PostgreSQL is MUCH better for concurrent usage.**

### **SQLite (Development):**
```
❌ Database-level write lock
❌ One writer blocks all operations
✅ WAL mode helps (concurrent reads during writes)
⚠️ Still limited for 10+ concurrent users
```

### **PostgreSQL (Production on Dokploy):**
```
✅ Row-level locking (not database-level)
✅ Multiple users can write simultaneously
✅ MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
✅ Designed for 100+ concurrent users
✅ No blocking issues like SQLite
```

### **Concurrency Comparison:**

| Scenario | SQLite + WAL | PostgreSQL |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| 1 user vetting | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| 5 users vetting | ⚠️ Some delays | ✅ No delays |
| 10 users vetting | ❌ Blocking | ✅ Smooth |
| 50+ users | ❌ Unusable | ✅ Excellent |
| Admin navigating during vetting | ⚠️ May delay | ✅ No delay |

### **Why PostgreSQL is Better:**

1. **Row-Level Locking:**
   - SQLite: Locks entire database for writes
   - PostgreSQL: Locks only the specific row being updated
   - Result: Multiple users can update different candidates simultaneously

2. **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control):**
   - Readers never block writers
   - Writers never block readers
   - Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot

3. **Connection Pooling:**
   - PostgreSQL supports true connection pooling
   - Our code uses: `pool_size=20, max_overflow=40`
   - Efficiently handles 60+ concurrent connections

4. **Write Performance:**
   - SQLite: Sequential writes (one at a time)
   - PostgreSQL: Parallel writes (multiple at once)

### **Your Deployment Will Be Smooth:**

✅ **No WAL mode needed** (PostgreSQL doesn't use WAL like SQLite)  
✅ **Connection pooling active** (pool_size=20, max_overflow=40)  
✅ **Row-level locking** (no blocking)  
✅ **10+ recruiters can vet simultaneously** without delays  
✅ **Admin can monitor in real-time** without freezing

## 🧪 Step 4: Post-Deployment Testing

### **Test 1: Database Migration**
```bash
# SSH into server
ssh your-dokploy-server

# Check if columns exist
psql -U username -d dbname -c "\d candidates"

# Should show:
# - is_deleted (boolean)
# - deleted_at (timestamp)
# - deleted_by (varchar)
# - deletion_reason (text)
```

### **Test 2: Soft Delete with User Tracking**
1. Login as **recruiter**
2. Delete a candidate
3. Login as **admin**
4. Go to "Deleted Candidates"
5. ✅ Verify shows: `recruiter@email.com (recruiter)` not "admin"

### **Test 3: Auto-Reload After Actions**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to "Deleted Candidates"
3. Click "Restore"
4. ✅ Verify: Green toast appears
5. ✅ Verify: List auto-refreshes (no manual refresh needed)
6. ✅ Verify: Candidate disappears from deleted list

### **Test 4: Hard Delete**
1. Delete a candidate (soft delete)
2. Go to "Deleted Candidates"
3. Click "Delete Forever"
4. Confirm in modal
5. ✅ Verify: Green toast "permanently deleted"
6. ✅ Verify: List auto-refreshes
7. ✅ Verify: Candidate gone from database

### **Test 5: Concurrent Vetting (CRITICAL)**
1. Open **3 browser windows**
2. Login as different users (recruiter, manager, admin)
3. All users: Start vetting resumes simultaneously
4. ✅ Verify: All vetting completes without delays
5. ✅ Verify: Admin can navigate dashboard during vetting
6. ✅ Verify: No blocking or freezing
7. ✅ Verify: Activity dashboard updates in real-time

### **Test 6: Activity Dashboard**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Activity Dashboard
3. ✅ Verify: All charts show real data
4. ✅ Verify: "Recent Activity" updates
5. ✅ Verify: "Top Performers" shows actual users
6. ✅ Verify: Auto-refresh works (10 seconds)

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### **Rollback Code:**
```bash
# On Dokploy server
git checkout mvp-1
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push origin mvp-1 --force
```

### **Rollback Database:**
**NOT NEEDED** - Migration is additive only (adds columns, doesn't modify data).

If absolutely necessary:
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
ALTER TABLE candidates DROP COLUMN is_deleted;
ALTER TABLE candidates DROP COLUMN deleted_at;
ALTER TABLE candidates DROP COLUMN deleted_by;
ALTER TABLE candidates DROP COLUMN deletion_reason;
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Migration Fails**
```
Error: Column already exists
```
**Solution:** Columns already added, skip migration.

### **Issue 2: Import Error**
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'get_current_user'
```
**Solution:** Already fixed in latest commit (d960456).

### **Issue 3: Toast Doesn't Appear**
**Solution:** Already fixed in latest commit (aaaaa96).

### **Issue 4: Slow Performance**
**Check:**
1. PostgreSQL connection pooling active?
2. Database indexes created?
3. Network latency to database?
