# Complete Implementation Summary

## ✅ All Tasks Completed

### 1. Resume Upload → Candidate Creation Flow
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- `templates/resumes/upload_new.html`: Redirects to `/candidates` after successful upload
- Success message informs users that candidates were auto-created
- Upload flow: Resume → Parse → Create Candidate → Redirect to candidates list

**How It Works:**
1. User uploads resume at `/resumes/upload-new`
2. System automatically parses resume (if `auto_parse=true`)
3. Creates candidate record with extracted data
4. Redirects user to `/candidates` page
5. New candidate appears in the list

   python main.py
   # Or
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Check Logs:**
   - Server logs show parsing details
   - Education extraction logging added
   - Error messages are more descriptive

3. **Debug Education Extraction:**

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Education Not Extracted
**Cause:** Resume format doesn't match expected patterns
**Solution:** 
- Fallback method now searches entire document
- Check server logs for details
- Manual entry via edit page
- See `EDUCATION_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md`

### Issue 2: Token Expired
**Cause:** JWT token has limited lifetime
**Solution:**
- Login again at `/login`
- All pages now handle this gracefully

### Issue 3: Candidate Details Not Loading
**Cause:** Database relationships not initialized
**Solution:**
- **Must restart server manually** (not just auto-reload)
- Ctrl+C then restart
