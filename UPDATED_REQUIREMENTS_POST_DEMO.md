---

### **2. EDUCATION VERIFICATION** üÜï
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Challenge:** LinkedIn scraping will get us blocked

#### **Requirement:**
Verify candidate's year of passing (education completion date) without scraping LinkedIn.

#### **Current Problem:**
- HR team manually checks LinkedIn for education dates
- Automated scraping = account blocks
- Need alternative verification method

#### **Proposed Solutions:**

**Option 1: Resume-Based Verification (RECOMMENDED)**
- Extract education dates from resume during vetting
- Compare against claimed dates
- Flag discrepancies for manual review
- Confidence score for date extraction

**Option 2: Third-Party Verification APIs**
- Integrate with education verification services:
  - **National Student Clearinghouse** (USA)
  - **Hedd** (UK)
  - **India Stack / DigiLocker** (India)
- Paid APIs but official verification
- Requires candidate consent

**Option 3: Email Verification**
- Verify using university email domains
- Check if `@university.edu` email is valid
- Works for recent graduates only

**Option 4: Document Upload**
- Request scanned degree/transcript upload
- OCR to extract dates
- Compare with resume claims
- Manual verification by HR

**Option 5: Hybrid Approach (BEST)**
1. Extract dates from resume (primary)
2. Cross-reference with uploaded documents (secondary)
3. Optionally use verification API (tertiary)
4. Flag major discrepancies (>2 years difference)
5. Manual review for flagged cases

#### **Implementation:**
- Add `education_verification_status` field to candidates
- Add `education_documents` table for uploaded proofs
- Add verification workflow to vetting process
- Display verification status in candidate profile

#### **Decision Needed:**
- Which verification method to implement?
- Budget for third-party APIs?
- Level of verification required (basic vs thorough)?

### **4. JOB HOPPING CRITERIA** üÜï
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** Vetting Enhancement

#### **Requirement:**
Add job hopping detection as a vetting criteria (currently missing from vetting system).

#### **What is Job Hopping?**
Multiple job changes in short periods indicating instability.

#### **Detection Rules:**

**Rule 1: Tenure Threshold**
- Job duration < 12 months = Red flag
- Job duration < 18 months = Yellow flag
- 2+ jobs < 12 months in last 5 years = Job hopper

**Rule 2: Pattern Detection**
- 3+ jobs in 3 years = Frequent job changer
- 4+ jobs in 5 years = Job hopper

**Rule 3: Career Level Adjustments**
- **Junior (<3 years exp):** More lenient (1-2 year stints acceptable)
- **Mid-level (3-7 years):** Moderate (2+ year stints expected)
- **Senior (7+ years):** Strict (3+ year stints expected)

**Rule 4: Exceptions (Don't penalize):**
- Contract/Freelance work (if labeled as such)
- Layoffs (if mentioned in resume)
- Company closures
- Startups (known for shorter tenures)
- Career changes (switching industries)

#### **Scoring Impact:**

**Severity Levels:**
- **Low Risk (Score: -5):** 1 short stint in otherwise stable career
- **Medium Risk (Score: -15):** 2 short stints in last 5 years
- **High Risk (Score: -30):** 3+ short stints, pattern of job hopping
- **Critical (Score: -50):** Extreme job hopping (5+ jobs in 3 years)

**Auto-Reject vs Penalize:**
- **Recommendation:** PENALIZE, don't auto-reject
- Reduce overall score but allow manual review
- Display prominently in vetting UI
- HR can override if candidate explains situation

#### **UI Display:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Job Hopping Alert: High Risk (-30 points)
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
‚Ä¢ 4 jobs in last 5 years
‚Ä¢ Average tenure: 13 months
‚Ä¢ Pattern detected: Frequent job changes

Recent Work History:
‚îú‚îÄ Company D (Current): 8 months
‚îú‚îÄ Company C: 11 months
‚îú‚îÄ Company B: 15 months
‚îî‚îÄ Company A: 18 months

‚ö†Ô∏è Consider asking about:
- Reasons for frequent changes
- Career goals and stability
- Long-term commitment
```

#### **Implementation:**
1. Add `job_hopping_score` to vetting results
2. Add `tenure_analysis` field with detailed breakdown
3. Update vetting algorithm to calculate job hopping risk
4. Add UI component to display job hopping analysis
5. Allow manual override with comment

## üìã CLARIFICATIONS ON EXISTING VETTING CRITERIA

### **1. LinkedIn Profile Validation**

#### **Decision Required:**
- **Basic Check (RECOMMENDED):** Just verify URL exists and is accessible
- **Advanced Check:** Validate it's active (requires API calls, costs $$$)

**Recommendation:**
- Check URL format and accessibility (free)
- Don't verify if profile is active (expensive, rate-limited)
- Consider integrating LinkedIn API later if budget allows

#### **Alternative Profiles:**
**Question:** Accept GitHub, portfolio, personal website?

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ YES
- Accept professional profiles as alternatives:
  - GitHub (for developers)
  - Behance (for designers)
  - Medium (for content creators)
  - Personal portfolio websites
- Weight slightly lower than LinkedIn (e.g., LinkedIn = 10 points, Others = 7 points)
- But don't penalize if they have strong professional presence elsewhere

---

### **2. Capitalization Consistency**

#### **Decision Required:**
**Ignore proper nouns and acronyms?**

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ YES
- Whitelist common proper nouns:
  - Technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS, GCP, Azure, React, Node.js
  - Companies: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Apple
  - Locations: New York, San Francisco, Bangalore, Mumbai
- Whitelist common acronyms:
  - MBA, PhD, CEO, CTO, HR, IT, AI, ML, DevOps
- Only flag inconsistency in regular text (e.g., "worked at GOOGLE" vs "worked at google")

**Threshold for "Inconsistent":**
- **Lenient:** >20% of text has inconsistent capitalization
- **Moderate (RECOMMENDED):** >15% inconsistent
- **Strict:** >10% inconsistent

---

### **3. Job Hopping Rules**

#### **Auto-Reject or Penalize?**
**Recommendation:** PENALIZE, don't auto-reject
- Reduce score significantly but allow manual review
- Different situations require different handling

#### **Junior vs Senior:**
**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ YES, different rules
- **Junior (<3 years):** Allow 1-2 year stints
- **Mid-level (3-7 years):** Expect 2+ year stints
- **Senior (7+ years):** Expect 3+ year stints

#### **Contract/Freelance Work:**
**Recommendation:** Don't count against job hopping
- Detect if labeled as "Contract", "Freelance", "Consultant"
- Exclude from job hopping calculation
- But mention in summary for context

---

### **4. Career Gaps**

#### **Affect Fake/Real Score?**
**Recommendation:** NO, don't affect authenticity score
- Career gaps don't indicate fake resume
- Many legitimate reasons (health, family, education, travel)
- Common for women (maternity leave, childcare)

**However:**
- ‚úÖ Display prominently in UI for manual review
- ‚úÖ Highlight gaps > 6 months
- ‚úÖ Ask candidate to explain in interview
- ‚ùå Don't reduce authenticity score

#### **UI Display:**
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Career Gap Detected: 14 months
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
Gap Period: Jan 2020 - Mar 2021
Duration: 14 months

üí° Common reasons (for reference):
‚Ä¢ Personal/health issues
‚Ä¢ Further education/certifications
‚Ä¢ Family responsibilities
‚Ä¢ Career transition/exploration
‚Ä¢ Pandemic-related layoff

‚ö†Ô∏è Recommend asking candidate during interview
```

---

### **5. Scoring Thresholds**

#### **Decision Required:**
Option A: Lenient (Score >= 70 = Qualified, < 50 = Reject, 50-70 = Review)  
Option B: Strict (Score >= 80 = Qualified, < 60 = Reject)

**Recommendation:** MODERATE (between A and B)
- **Score >= 75:** ‚úÖ **Auto-Qualified** (green badge)
- **Score 60-74:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual Review Required** (yellow badge)
- **Score < 60:** ‚ùå **Likely Reject** (red badge, but not auto-reject)

**Rationale:**
- Lenient enough to not reject good candidates with minor issues
- Strict enough to filter out obvious fakes
- Large "manual review" zone (60-74) for edge cases
- HR always has final decision (no auto-reject)

**Score Breakdown Example:**
```
Overall Score: 68 / 100 ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Review

‚úÖ LinkedIn Present: +10
‚úÖ Email Valid: +10
‚úÖ Phone Valid: +10
‚ö†Ô∏è Capitalization Issues: -5
‚ö†Ô∏è Job Hopping Detected: -15
‚úÖ Education Verified: +10
‚úÖ Skills Match: +20
‚ö†Ô∏è Career Gap (1 year): 0 (no penalty)
‚úÖ No Red Flags: +28

Recommendation: REVIEW - Candidate has job hopping 
history but otherwise solid profile. Recommend interview
to understand job changes.
```

### **6. False Positives Handling**

#### **Edge Cases to Handle:**

**A. Career Changers**
- Person switching from teaching to tech (low skills match)
- **Solution:** Don't penalize if resume explains career change
- Detect phrases: "career change", "transitioning to", "pivoting to"

**B. Returning Parents**
- Long career gap (2-3 years) for childcare
- **Solution:** Don't penalize gaps for this reason
- Detect phrases: "maternity leave", "childcare", "family responsibilities"

**C. Recent Graduates**
- No work experience, only education
- **Solution:** Separate scoring for entry-level candidates
- Lower experience weight, higher education weight

**D. International Candidates**
- Different date formats, name formats
- **Solution:** Support international formats in extraction
- Don't penalize formatting differences

**E. Freelancers/Consultants**
- Multiple short projects (looks like job hopping)
- **Solution:** Detect freelance/contract keywords
- Treat differently from regular employment

#### **Manual Override:**
**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ YES, must have
- HR can override any vetting decision
- Require comment explaining override
- Track override patterns (if one HR overrides frequently, may need training)

**UI Feature:**
