## 🔍 Why You're Seeing Only "•" 

### **Issue:** Old Candidates
If you're seeing only a single bullet point, it's because:

1. **Old Extraction:** The candidate was uploaded **before** we enhanced the LLM extraction
2. **Old Data:** The database still has the old extraction without detailed responsibilities
3. **Display Works:** The UI code is correct and ready to show responsibilities

### **Timeline:**
- **Before Oct 16, 2025 ~7:00 PM:** Basic extraction (minimal responsibilities)
- **After Oct 16, 2025 ~9:00 PM:** Enhanced extraction (full responsibilities)

## ✅ Solution: Re-Upload Resumes

### **For Existing Candidates:**
1. Delete the candidate (soft delete)
2. Re-upload the same resume
3. System will:
   - ✅ Extract all responsibilities as bullet points
   - ✅ Display them beautifully in the UI
   - ✅ Restore the candidate with fresh data
