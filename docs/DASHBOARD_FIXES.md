# Dashboard API Fixes
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Issue:** 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/v1/dashboard/hr`

---

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Import Path Issue** ✅ FIXED BY USER
**Problem:** Incorrect import paths for models  
**Original:**
```python
from models.resume import Resume
from models.candidate import Candidate
```

**Fixed:**
```python
from models.database import Resume
from models.database import Candidate
```

**Status:** ✅ User corrected this

---

### 2. **Field Name Mismatches** ✅ FIXED

#### Issue A: Resume.uploaded_at → Resume.upload_date
**Problem:** Code referenced `Resume.uploaded_at` but model uses `Resume.upload_date`

**Locations Fixed:**
- Line 95: `order_by(desc(Resume.upload_date))`
- Line 104: `resume.upload_date.isoformat()`
- Line 201: `order_by(desc(Resume.upload_date))`
- Line 209: `resume.upload_date.isoformat()`

#### Issue B: Candidate.name → Candidate.full_name
**Problem:** Code referenced `Candidate.name` but model uses `Candidate.full_name`

**Locations Fixed:**
- Line 123: `candidate.full_name`
- Line 236: `candidate.full_name`

#### Issue C: Resume.position field doesn't exist
**Problem:** Code tried to access `resume.position` which doesn't exist in Resume model

**Fixed:**
- Line 105: Set to `None` with comment

#### Issue D: Candidate.overall_score doesn't exist
**Problem:** Code tried to access `candidate.overall_score` which doesn't exist yet

**Fixed:**
- Line 124: Set to `None` with comment

#### Issue E: Candidate.position doesn't exist
**Problem:** Code tried to access `candidate.position` which doesn't exist

**Fixed:**
- Line 126: Set to `None` with comment

---

### 3. **Status Value Mismatches** ✅ FIXED

#### Issue: Candidate status "shortlisted" → "screened"
**Problem:** Code used `"shortlisted"` but Candidate model constraint only allows:
- `'new', 'screened', 'interviewed', 'offered', 'hired', 'rejected', 'archived'`

**Locations Fixed:**
- Line 74: Changed to `"screened"` in stats query
- Line 228: Changed to `["screened", "interviewed", "offered", "hired"]` in activity feed

---

## 📋 Summary of Changes

### Files Modified
- ✅ `api/v1/dashboard.py` - Fixed all field name and status mismatches

### Changes Made
1. ✅ Fixed 4 instances of `uploaded_at` → `upload_date`
2. ✅ Fixed 2 instances of `candidate.name` → `candidate.full_name`
3. ✅ Set non-existent fields to `None` with comments
4. ✅ Fixed status values to match model constraints

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After these fixes, the dashboard API should:
1. ✅ Return 200 OK instead of 500 error
2. ✅ Show correct data from database
3. ✅ Display pending vetting resumes
4. ✅ Display recent candidates
5. ✅ Display recent activity

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the API directly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/dashboard/hr
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "stats": {
    "total_candidates": <number>,
    "pending_vetting": <number>,
    "shortlisted": <number>,
    "active_jobs": 8
  },
  "pending_vetting": [...],
  "recent_candidates": [...],
  "active_jobs": [...],
  "recent_activity": [...]
}
```

### In Browser:
1. Visit `http://localhost:8000/`
2. Dashboard should load without errors
3. Check browser console (F12) - no errors
4. Widgets should populate with data

---

## 📝 Notes for Future

### Missing Fields in Models

These fields were referenced in the dashboard but don't exist in the current models:

**Resume Model:**
- `position` - Consider adding if needed for filtering

**Candidate Model:**
- `overall_score` - Should be added for ranking candidates
- `position` - Should be added to track what position they applied for

### Recommended Model Enhancements

```python
# In Resume model:
position = Column(String(255))  # Position applied for

# In Candidate model:
overall_score = Column(Integer)  # Overall assessment score (0-100)
position = Column(String(255))  # Current/desired position
```
