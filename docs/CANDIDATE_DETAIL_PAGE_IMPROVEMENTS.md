## üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 1. **Resume View/Download Buttons**
**Status:** Partially Working  
**Current State:**
- View button: Opens `/resumes/{id}/preview` ‚úÖ
- Download button: Calls `/api/v1/resumes/{id}/download` ‚úÖ

**Issue:** Need to verify these endpoints exist and work correctly

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Test view button functionality
- [ ] Test download button functionality
- [ ] Verify resume preview page loads correctly
- [ ] Add error handling for missing resumes

---

### 2. **Authenticity Score Accuracy**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE  
**Current State:**
- Shows score of 37 when vetting showed 70+
- Using `latestResume.authenticity_score` from database

**Root Cause:**
- Vetting analysis data is NOT being persisted to database
- Background task re-analyzes resume (may give different score)
- Vetting session data is temporary and gets lost

**Proposed Solution:**
```
VETTING FLOW:
1. User uploads ‚Üí Scan & analyze (authenticity, extraction)
2. Store analysis in vetting_session.scan_results
3. User approves ‚Üí Upload to database
4. **PRESERVE vetting analysis data in Resume record**
5. Background task uses existing data (no re-analysis)
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Store vetting authenticity_details in Resume.authenticity_details
- [ ] Store vetting authenticity_score in Resume.authenticity_score
- [ ] Modify background task to skip re-analysis if data exists
- [ ] Update upload_approved endpoint to pass vetting scores
- [ ] Verify scores match between vetting and candidate detail page

**Technical Changes Needed:**
```python
# In api/v1/vetting.py - upload_approved endpoint
resume = Resume(
    file_name=resume_data['file_name'],
    file_path=resume_data['file_path'],
    raw_text=scan_result.get('extracted_text'),  # Already doing ‚úÖ
    extracted_data=scan_result.get('extracted_data'),  # Already doing ‚úÖ
    authenticity_score=scan_result.get('authenticity_score'),  # ADD THIS
    authenticity_details=scan_result.get('authenticity_details'),  # ADD THIS
    upload_status='pending'
)
```

### 3. **View Detailed Analysis Button**
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Current State:** Button exists but does nothing

**Proposed Solution:**
- Create `/candidates/{id}/analysis` page

  - Experience verification
  - Red flags detected
  - Recommendations

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create analysis detail page template

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY / NICE TO HAVE

### Phase 2 (Important - Do Soon)
4. Edit candidate details functionality
5. Fix work experience descriptions
6. Fix location field accuracy

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT

### Data Flow Optimization
**Current Problem:** Data is extracted/analyzed multiple times
1. Vetting: Extract + Analyze
2. Upload: Re-extract + Re-analyze (background task)

**Proposed Solution:** Single source of truth
1. Vetting: Extract + Analyze (STORE RESULTS)
2. Upload: Use stored results (NO re-processing)

**Benefits:**
- Faster processing
- Consistent scores
- Reduced server load
- Better user experience

---

## üìù NOTES

- All vetting analysis data should be preserved and reused
- Background processing should be optional/supplementary
- User sees same scores they approved during vetting
- Edit functionality is essential for data correction
- Quick Actions can be implemented incrementally

**Last Updated:** Oct 10, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Next Review:** After Phase 1 completion
