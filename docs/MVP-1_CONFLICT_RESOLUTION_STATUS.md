## ‚úÖ RESOLVED (2/18)

### 1. requirements.txt
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Strategy:** Merged all dependencies from both branches, organized by category
- **Result:** Clean merged file with 69 lines, all unique dependencies included

### 2. core/config.py
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Strategy:** Merged settings from both branches, kept all configuration options
- **Key Changes:**
  - Combined JWT settings from job-creation branch
  - Kept vetting-specific settings from resume-upload branch

## ‚è≥ PENDING (16/18)

### High Priority - Core Infrastructure

#### 3. core/database.py ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- **Conflict Type:** both added (different implementations)
- **Strategy:** Use job-creation version (async SQLAlchemy), ensure compatibility with current models
- **Risk:** HIGH - Core database layer, affects all models

#### 4. models/database.py ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- **Conflict Type:** both added (different model structures)
- **Strategy:** Merge all models - User (from job-creation), Candidate/Resume (from resume-upload)
- **Risk:** HIGH - All models must coexist without FK conflicts

#### 5. main.py ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL  
- **Conflict Type:** both modified (extensive route additions)
- **Strategy:** Merge all routes, add auth middleware, ensure no route conflicts
- **Risk:** HIGH - Core application file

---

### Medium Priority - Services

#### 6. services/auth_service.py
- **Conflict Type:** both added
- **Strategy:** Use job-creation version (more robust with JWT), add vetting-specific methods if needed

#### 7. services/candidate_service.py
- **Conflict Type:** both added
- **Strategy:** Merge both - keep vetting methods from resume-upload, add CRUD from job-creation

#### 8. services/resume_service.py
- **Conflict Type:** both added
- **Strategy:** Merge both - keep vetting/upload logic from resume-upload, add API methods from job-creation

#### 9. services/document_processor.py
- **Conflict Type:** both modified
- **Strategy:** Keep resume-upload version (more advanced extraction), add any missing utils

#### 10. services/resume_analyzer.py
- **Conflict Type:** both modified
- **Strategy:** Keep resume-upload version (has vetting system), ensure compatibility

---

### Medium Priority - Templates

#### 11. templates/index.html
- **Conflict Type:** both modified
- **Strategy:** Use resume-upload as base (better dashboard), add cards for job/user features
- **Action:** Add 4 new feature cards (Login, Jobs, Jobs Dashboard, Users)

#### 12. templates/upload.html
- **Conflict Type:** both modified
- **Strategy:** Keep resume-upload version (has progress tracking), ensure routes match

---

### Low Priority - Documentation

#### 13. docs/prd/02-RESUME_UPLOAD_PRD.md
- **Conflict Type:** both added
- **Strategy:** Use resume-upload version (more detailed), append job-creation insights if any

#### 14. docs/prd/06-JOB_CREATION_PRD.md
- **Conflict Type:** both added
- **Strategy:** Use job-creation version (actual implementation details)

#### 15. docs/prd/10-USER_MANAGEMENT_PRD.md
- **Conflict Type:** both added
- **Strategy:** Use job-creation version (actual implementation details)

---

### Low Priority - Tests

#### 16. tests/test_jd_matcher.py
- **Conflict Type:** both modified
- **Strategy:** Merge test cases from both

#### 17. tests/test_resume_processing.py
- **Conflict Type:** both modified
- **Strategy:** Merge test cases from both

#### 18. models/schemas.py
- **Conflict Type:** both modified
- **Strategy:** Merge all schema definitions

## üìã Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (NEXT)
1. ‚úÖ requirements.txt
2. ‚úÖ core/config.py
3. ‚è≥ core/database.py - Use job-creation version
4. ‚è≥ models/database.py - Merge all models carefully
5. ‚è≥ models/schemas.py - Merge all schemas

### Phase 2: Main Application
6. ‚è≥ main.py - Merge all routes and middleware

### Phase 3: Services
7. ‚è≥ services/auth_service.py
8. ‚è≥ services/candidate_service.py
9. ‚è≥ services/resume_service.py
10. ‚è≥ services/document_processor.py
11. ‚è≥ services/resume_analyzer.py

### Phase 4: UI/Templates
12. ‚è≥ templates/index.html
13. ‚è≥ templates/upload.html

### Phase 5: Documentation & Tests
14-18. ‚è≥ Remaining docs and tests

## üéØ Next Actions

1. Resolve core/database.py (use job-creation version, test imports)
2. Resolve models/database.py (merge all model classes)
3. Resolve main.py (merge all routes)
4. Test application startup
5. Continue with services and templates

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks Identified

1. **Database Model Conflicts:** Current branch uses modular models (`models/db/`), job-creation uses consolidated. Need to merge carefully.
2. **Route Conflicts:** Both branches may define similar routes with different implementations
3. **Import Issues:** Changing model structure may break imports across the codebase
4. **Authentication Dependency:** Job-creation routes require auth, resume-upload routes don't

---

## üí° Key Decisions Made

1. **Keep `/api/v1/` versioning** from resume-upload (better API evolution)
2. **Use async SQLAlchemy** from job-creation (better performance)
3. **Merge all unique services** from both branches
4. **Keep current branding** (purple gradient, emoji icons)
5. **Make authentication optional initially** to avoid breaking existing features

---

**Last Updated:** After resolving requirements.txt and core/config.py
**Next Target:** core/database.py
