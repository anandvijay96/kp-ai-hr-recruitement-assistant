# Google Search-Based LinkedIn Verification

**Feature:** Automatic LinkedIn profile verification via Google Search  
**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing  

---

## üìã Overview

This feature implements an intelligent LinkedIn **cross-verification** system that mimics your HR team's manual verification process. Instead of requiring expensive LinkedIn API access, the system uses Google Search to verify if a candidate has a legitimate LinkedIn profile by searching for their name, email, and phone number.

**üîë KEY CHANGE:** Google Search verification is now **MANDATORY** and runs for **ALL** resumes (even if LinkedIn URL is present). This ensures authenticity by cross-checking that LinkedIn profiles actually exist online and aren't fake URLs.

### Problem Solved

Previously, the system could only check if a LinkedIn URL was **present in the resume**. This had critical limitations:
- ‚ùå Candidates could omit their LinkedIn URL from the resume
- ‚ùå Candidates could **fake** LinkedIn URLs (e.g., linkedin.com/in/fake-profile)
- ‚ùå No way to verify if the profile actually exists online
- ‚ùå No cross-verification against real-world online presence
- ‚ùå Missed opportunity to detect fraudulent resumes

### Solution

Now the system performs **mandatory** Google Search cross-verification:
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** searches Google for: `"[Name] [Email] [Phone] LinkedIn"`
- ‚úÖ Runs for **ALL** resumes (even if LinkedIn URL is present)
- ‚úÖ Cross-verifies LinkedIn URLs found in resumes
- ‚úÖ Detects **suspicious/fake** profiles (in resume but not online)
- ‚úÖ Analyzes search results for LinkedIn profile links
- ‚úÖ Calculates confidence score based on cross-verification
- ‚úÖ Works **without** expensive LinkedIn API access
- ‚úÖ Fallback mode if Google API not configured (reduced scores)

## üîß How It Works

### Verification Flow

```
1. Resume Uploaded
   ‚Üì
2. Extract Candidate Info (Name, Email, Phone)
   ‚Üì
3. Check Resume for LinkedIn URL
   ‚Üì
4. If NO LinkedIn in resume ‚Üí Trigger Google Search
   ‚Üì
5. Google Search: "[Name] [Email] [Phone] LinkedIn"
   ‚Üì
6. Analyze Search Results
   ‚Üì
7. Extract LinkedIn Profile URLs
   ‚Üì
8. Calculate Confidence Score (0-100%)
   ‚Üì
9. Update Authenticity Score
```

### Scoring Logic (Mandatory Cross-Verification)

| Scenario | LinkedIn Score | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| LinkedIn in resume **AND** verified on Google | **100%** | ‚úÖ Cross-Verified (Best) |
| LinkedIn verified on Google (not in resume) | **75%** | ‚úÖ Verified Online |
| LinkedIn in resume but **API not configured** | **70%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't Cross-Verify |
| Other professional profiles + online presence | **60%** | ‚óã Alternative Verified |
| LinkedIn in resume but **NOT on Google** | **50%** | üö® SUSPICIOUS - Possible Fake |
| Other professional profiles only | **50%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative Only |
| Limited online presence | **20-40%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak Presence |
| No profile found anywhere | **0%** | ‚ùå Not Found |

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Google Search is now **MANDATORY** for proper scoring. If a LinkedIn URL is in the resume but cannot be verified on Google, the score is reduced to 50% as this is considered suspicious (possible fake profile).

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Option 1: With Google Search API (Recommended)

**Step 1: Get Google Custom Search API Key**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable "Custom Search API"
4. Create credentials ‚Üí API Key
5. Copy your API key

**Step 2: Create Custom Search Engine**

1. Go to [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)
2. Click "Add" to create new search engine
3. **Sites to search:** Leave empty (search entire web)
4. Name your search engine: "LinkedIn Verification"
5. Click "Create"
6. Copy your **Search Engine ID** (format: `abc123def456:xyz789`)

**Step 3: Configure Application**

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Google Search API Settings
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_actual_search_engine_id_here
```

**Step 4: Restart Application**

```bash
# Stop the application
# Then restart
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You should see in logs:
```
INFO: Google Search verification enabled for LinkedIn profile checks
```

### Option 2: Without Google API (Reduced Scoring Mode)

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** If you don't configure Google API:
- System will only check for LinkedIn URL **in the resume**
- **No cross-verification** will be performed
- **All LinkedIn scores will be capped at 70%** (can't verify authenticity)
- Candidates with LinkedIn in resume get 70% (not 100%)
- Candidates without LinkedIn get 0-50% (no way to verify)
- **Cannot detect fake LinkedIn URLs**
- You'll see in logs:
```
INFO: Google Search API not configured - LinkedIn verification will be limited to resume content only
```

**Recommendation:** Configure Google API for full cross-verification capability.

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Handling

‚úÖ **What is sent to Google:**
- Candidate name (required)
- Email (optional, if available)
- Phone (optional, if available)
- Search term: "LinkedIn"

‚úÖ **What is NOT stored:**
- Google API requests are logged but not persisted
- Search results cached temporarily (30min) then discarded
- No permanent storage of Google responses

‚úÖ **Privacy Compliance:**
- Candidate info already provided in resume
- Google search mimics manual HR verification process
- No unauthorized data scraping or collection
- Compliant with standard HR practices

### API Key Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:**
- Never commit API keys to Git
- Use `.env` file (already in `.gitignore`)
- Restrict API key to specific IPs if possible
- Enable API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
- Rotate keys periodically (every 90 days)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API quota exceeded"

**Cause:** You've exceeded 100 free searches/day

**Solutions:**
1. Upgrade to paid tier ($5/1000 queries)
2. Reduce search frequency (cache results longer)
3. Only search when no LinkedIn in resume

### Issue: "Invalid API key"

**Cause:** API key not configured correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `.env` file has correct key
2. Check API key in Google Cloud Console
3. Ensure Custom Search API is enabled
4. Restart application after changing .env

### Issue: "No results found" for known candidates

**Cause:** Search engine settings or candidate has no online presence

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Custom Search Engine is set to search "entire web" (not specific sites)
2. Try manual Google search to confirm profile exists
3. Check if candidate name is too common (e.g., "John Smith")
4. System working correctly - candidate truly has no LinkedIn

### Issue: "Search attempted: false"

**Cause:** API not configured

**Solution:**
- Add `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` to `.env`
- Restart application

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Semantic Matching**
   - Match names with typos or variations
   - "John Doe" vs "Jon Doe" vs "J. Doe"

2. **Profile Validation**
   - Click through to LinkedIn and verify profile details
   - Check if profile matches resume information

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Queue Google searches for bulk uploads
   - Optimize API quota usage

4. **Alternative Search Engines**
   - Bing API (more generous free tier)
   - DuckDuckGo (privacy-focused)

5. **Machine Learning**
   - Train model to identify relevant vs irrelevant search results
   - Improve confidence scoring accuracy
