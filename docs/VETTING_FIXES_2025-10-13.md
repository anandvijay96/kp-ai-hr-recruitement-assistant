# Vetting Page Fixes - October 13, 2025
**📅 Date:** October 13, 2025 - 3:10 AM IST  
**🎯 Goal:** Fix candidate detail page showing entire resume text

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Professional Summary Field Error ✅
**Error:** `'professional_summary' is an invalid keyword argument for Candidate`  
**Fix:** Removed `professional_summary` field from Candidate creation (line 452)  
**Status:** Fixed

### 2. Work Experience & Education Data Validation ✅
**Problem:** Entire resume text being stored in description fields  
**Root Cause:** 
- No validation that `education_data` and `experience_data` are lists
- No length limits on description fields
- Extraction might be failing and returning strings instead of arrays

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Type Validation:** Check if data is a list before processing
2. **Description Length Limit:** Cap at 1000 characters
3. **List Handling:** If description is a list (responsibilities), join first 5 items
4. **Better Logging:** Log when data types are incorrect

**Files Modified:**
- `api/v1/vetting.py` (lines 489-548)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue has two parts:

### Part 1: Data Already in Database
**Problem:** Existing candidates have full resume text in education/experience  
**Why:** Previous uploads didn't have validation  
**Solution:** Need to clean up existing data OR re-upload resumes

### Part 2: Extraction Might Be Failing
**Problem:** `EnhancedResumeExtractor` might not be parsing correctly  
**Why:** Complex resume formats, extraction patterns not matching  
**Solution:** Added logging to see what's being extracted

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Upload New Resume
1. Go to `/vet-resumes`
2. Upload a resume
3. Approve it
4. Click "Upload Approved to Database"
5. Check terminal logs for:
   ```
   INFO: Storing X education records for [name]
   INFO: Storing Y work experience records for [name]
   WARNING: Education data is not a list: <type>
   WARNING: Work experience data is not a list: <type>
   ```

### Test 2: Check Candidate Detail
1. Go to candidate detail page
2. Check if Work Experience shows:
   - Company name
   - Job title
   - Dates
   - Description (NOT entire resume)
3. Check if Education shows:
   - Degree
   - Institution
   - Dates
   - (NOT entire resume)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Issue 1: Existing Data Corrupted
**Symptom:** Old candidates still show full resume text  
**Why:** Data was stored before validation was added  
**Fix Options:**
1. **Option A:** Delete and re-upload those candidates
2. **Option B:** Create a data cleanup script
3. **Option C:** Manually edit in database

### Issue 2: Professional Summary Not Extracted
**Symptom:** "No professional summary available"  
**Why:** Candidate model doesn't have `professional_summary` field  
**Fix Options:**
1. **Option A:** Add field to Candidate model (requires migration)
2. **Option B:** Store in Resume.parsed_data JSON field
3. **Option C:** Extract on-the-fly when displaying

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. ✅ Test new upload with validation
2. ✅ Check terminal logs for extraction warnings
3. ✅ Verify new candidates display correctly

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **Add Professional Summary Field**
   - Create migration to add `summary` TEXT field to `candidates` table
   - Update vetting endpoint to store it
   - Update candidate detail page to display it

2. **Data Cleanup Script**
   - Create script to identify corrupted records
   - Option to delete and re-extract
   - Or truncate long descriptions

### Long Term (Next Sprint)
1. **Improve Resume Extraction**
   - Better parsing patterns
   - Handle more resume formats
   - Use AI/ML for extraction (GPT-4, etc.)

2. **Validation Dashboard**
   - Show extraction quality scores
   - Flag candidates with poor extraction
   - Allow manual editing of extracted data

## 🔧 Code Changes Summary

### File: `api/v1/vetting.py`

#### Change 1: Remove professional_summary (Line 452)
```python
# BEFORE
candidate = Candidate(
    ...
    professional_summary=extracted_data.get('summary'),  # ❌ Field doesn't exist
    ...
)

# AFTER
candidate = Candidate(
    ...
    # professional_summary removed ✅
    ...
)
```

#### Change 2: Validate Education Data (Lines 489-512)
```python
# BEFORE
education_data = extracted_data.get('education', [])
if education_data:
    for edu in education_data:
        # No validation

# AFTER
education_data = extracted_data.get('education', [])
if education_data and isinstance(education_data, list):  # ✅ Type check
    logger.info(f"Storing {len(education_data)} education records")
    for edu in education_data:
        if not isinstance(edu, dict):  # ✅ Validate each item
            logger.warning(f"Skipping invalid education entry")
            continue
        # ... rest of code
else:
    logger.warning(f"Education data is not a list: {type(education_data)}")
```

#### Change 3: Validate & Limit Work Experience (Lines 514-548)
```python
# BEFORE
experience_data = extracted_data.get('work_experience', [])
if experience_data:
    for exp in experience_data:
        work_exp = WorkExperience(
            ...
            description=exp.get('description')  # ❌ Could be entire resume
        )

# AFTER
experience_data = extracted_data.get('work_experience', [])
if experience_data and isinstance(experience_data, list):  # ✅ Type check
    logger.info(f"Storing {len(experience_data)} work experience records")
    for exp in experience_data:
        if not isinstance(exp, dict):  # ✅ Validate each item
            logger.warning(f"Skipping invalid experience entry")
            continue
        
        # ✅ Limit description length
        description = exp.get('description', '')
        if isinstance(description, list):
            description = '\n'.join(description[:5])  # First 5 items
        elif isinstance(description, str) and len(description) > 1000:
            description = description[:1000] + '...'  # Cap at 1000 chars
        
        work_exp = WorkExperience(
            ...
            description=description  # ✅ Limited length
        )
else:
    logger.warning(f"Work experience data is not a list: {type(experience_data)}")
```
