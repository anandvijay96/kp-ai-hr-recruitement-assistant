**📅 Date:** October 13, 2025 - 3:25 AM IST  
**🎯 Goal:** Fix candidate detail page and focus on MVP completion

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Added "Edit Candidate" Button ✅
**Location:** Candidate Detail Page → Quick Actions section  
**Button:** Yellow "Edit Candidate" button at the top of Quick Actions

- Allows HR to manually edit:
  - Personal info (name, email, phone, location)
  - Professional summary
  - Skills
  - Work experience
  - Education
  - Certifications
- Saves changes back to database

**File Modified:** `templates/candidate_detail.html`

## 🔧 How to Fix Corrupted Candidates

### Option 1: Use Edit Button (Recommended for MVP)
1. Go to candidate detail page
2. Click **"Edit Candidate"** button (yellow, top of Quick Actions)
3. Edit modal will open
4. Manually fix:
   - Work Experience (delete corrupted entries, add correct ones)
   - Education (delete corrupted entries, add correct ones)
   - Location
   - Professional Summary
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Option 2: Delete and Re-upload
1. Delete the corrupted candidate
2. Re-upload the resume through vetting page
3. New extraction will use improved validation

### Option 3: Run SQL Cleanup (Advanced)
**File:** `scripts/cleanup_corrupted_candidates.sql`

**Safe option - Truncate long descriptions:**
```sql
UPDATE work_experience 
SET description = SUBSTRING(description, 1, 500) || '...'
WHERE LENGTH(description) > 2000;
```

**Nuclear option - Delete corrupted candidates:**
```sql
DELETE FROM work_experience WHERE LENGTH(description) > 2000;
DELETE FROM education WHERE LENGTH(degree) > 500;
```

## 🐛 Known Issues (Existing Data)

### Issue 1: Professional Summary Not Showing
**Why:** Candidate model doesn't have `professional_summary` field  
**Impact:** Summary not extracted or displayed  
**Fix for MVP:** Use Edit button to add summary manually  
**Future:** Add field to database (requires migration)

### Issue 2: Wrong Location
**Why:** Extraction might pick wrong text as location  
**Impact:** Shows incorrect location  
**Fix for MVP:** Use Edit button to correct location  
**Future:** Improve extraction patterns

### Issue 3: Work Experience Shows Full Resume
**Why:** Old data was stored before validation was added  
**Impact:** Unreadable work experience section  
**Fix for MVP:** 
- Option A: Use Edit button to fix manually
- Option B: Delete candidate and re-upload
- Option C: Run SQL cleanup script
