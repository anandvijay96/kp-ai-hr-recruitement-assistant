## üîç Key Structural Differences

### API Structure
**Current Branch:**
- `api/v1/auth.py`
- `api/v1/candidates.py`
- `api/v1/resumes.py`
- `api/v1/vetting.py`

**Remote Branch:**
- `api/auth.py` (flattened structure)
- `api/candidates.py`
- `api/jobs.py`
- `api/jobs_management.py`
- `api/resumes.py`
- `api/users.py`

**Decision:** Keep current branch's `/v1/` versioning structure as it's better for API evolution.

### Database Models
**Current Branch:**
- Separate model files in `models/db/` directory
- `models/filter_models.py` for filtering
- `models/resume_models.py`

**Remote Branch:**
- Consolidated in `models/database.py`
- Schema files in `models/*_schemas.py`
- More comprehensive User model with RBAC

**Decision:** Merge both approaches - keep modular structure but add new schemas.

### Services
**Current Branch (Unique):**
- `services/vetting_session.py`
- `services/enhanced_resume_extractor.py`
- `services/filter_service.py`
- `services/export_service.py`

**Remote Branch (Unique):**
- `services/job_service.py`
- `services/job_management_service.py`
- `services/user_management_service.py`
- `services/permission_service.py`
- `services/audit_service.py`
- `services/password_service.py`

**Decision:** Keep all unique services from both branches.

### Templates
**Current Branch:**
- `templates/vet_resumes.html` (vetting workflow)
- `templates/candidate_*.html` (candidate management)
- `templates/resume_upload.html`
- `templates/resume_preview.html`

**Remote Branch:**
- `templates/auth/*.html` (login/register)
- `templates/jobs/*.html` (job management)
- `templates/jobs_management/*.html` (dashboard)
- `templates/users/*.html` (user management)
- `templates/candidates/*.html` (alternative structure)
- `templates/resumes/*.html` (alternative structure)

**Decision:** Merge all templates, keep current branch's candidate/resume pages but add auth, jobs, and users templates.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Conflicts to Resolve

### 1. **main.py** - Core Application File
**Conflicts:**
- Both branches have extensive route definitions
- Different middleware configurations
- Authentication requirements differ

**Resolution Strategy:**
- Merge all routes from both branches
- Add authentication middleware from remote branch
- Keep current branch's vetting endpoints
- Add job and user management endpoints
- Ensure backward compatibility

### 2. **core/database.py** - Database Configuration
**Conflicts:**
- Different database initialization approaches

**Resolution Strategy:**
- Use remote branch's database.py as base (more robust)
- Ensure compatibility with current models

### 3. **models/database.py** - Database Models
**Conflicts:**
- Current branch has modular models in `models/db/`
- Remote branch has consolidated models

**Resolution Strategy:**
- Merge User model from remote branch (with RBAC)
- Keep current branch's Candidate, Resume, Skills models
- Add Job-related models from remote branch
- Ensure foreign key relationships work

### 4. **templates/index.html** - Dashboard
**Conflicts:**
- Current branch: 4 features (vetting, upload, JD matching, candidates)
- Remote branch: 2 features (authenticity, JD matching)

**Resolution Strategy:**
- Use current branch's dashboard as base (more complete)
- Add cards for new features:
  - üîê User Management
  - üíº Job Management
  - üìä Jobs Dashboard
  - üë§ Login/Register

### 5. **requirements.txt** - Dependencies
**Conflicts:**
- Both branches may have different package versions

**Resolution Strategy:**
- Merge dependencies
- Use higher version numbers where conflicts exist
- Test all features after merge

## üéØ Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (CURRENT)
- [x] Fetch remote branch
- [x] Analyze differences
- [x] Create merge plan

    - No circular dependencies

---

## üö® Critical Issues to Watch

### 1. **API Route Conflicts**
- Both branches may define same routes differently
- **Solution:** Namespace routes properly, use `/api/v1/` prefix

### 2. **Database Model Conflicts**
- Current branch uses modular models
- Remote branch uses consolidated models
- **Solution:** Keep best of both, ensure migrations align

### 3. **Authentication Dependency**
- Remote branch requires authentication for most routes
- Current branch has open routes
- **Solution:** Add optional authentication, gradually enforce

### 4. **Circular Import Issues**
- Complex service dependencies can cause circular imports
- **Solution:** Use lazy imports, proper dependency injection

### 5. **Session Management**
- Both branches may handle sessions differently
- **Solution:** Standardize on remote branch's approach (more robust)

---

## üìã Files to Merge Carefully

### High Risk (Manual Merge Required)
1. `main.py` - Core application, many conflicts expected
2. `core/database.py` - Different initialization approaches
3. `models/database.py` - Model definitions differ
4. `requirements.txt` - Dependency conflicts
5. `templates/index.html` - Dashboard structure

### Medium Risk (Review After Merge)
1. `core/config.py` - Configuration settings
2. `services/*_service.py` - Service implementations
3. `api/*.py` - API route definitions
4. Migration scripts - Database schema changes

### Low Risk (Auto-merge OK)
1. Static files (CSS, JS)
2. Documentation files
3. Test files (merge both sets)
4. Template files (no overlaps)

---

## üé® Branding Consistency

**Current Branch Branding:**
- Gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`
- Colors: Purple/blue theme
- Icons: Emoji-based (üõ°Ô∏è, üîç, üéØ, üë•)
- Title: "AI Powered HR Assistant"
- Navigation: Dark navbar with brand emoji ü§ñ

**Action:** Apply this branding to all templates from remote branch.
