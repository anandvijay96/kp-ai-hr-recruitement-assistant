## üìã REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### ~~Sprint 1: Batch Upload & Duplicate Detection~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Status:** Already implemented  
**Skip to Sprint 2!**

---

### **Sprint 2: Resume-Job Auto-Matching** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è START HERE
**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Duration:** 4-5 days  
**Goal:** Auto-match resumes to jobs, show scores

#### What's Missing:
Currently, when a resume is uploaded, it's NOT automatically matched to jobs. We need to:
1. Calculate match scores when resume is uploaded
2. Store matches in database
3. Display match scores in UI
4. Show top matches for each job

#### Tasks:
1. **Matching Algorithm** (2 days)
   - **Skill Matching:** Compare resume skills vs job requirements
   - **Experience Matching:** Years of experience vs job requirements
   - **Education Matching:** Degree level vs job requirements
   - **Composite Score:** Weighted average (0-100)
   
2. **Auto-Match Service** (1 day)
   - Trigger matching on resume upload
   - Match against all active jobs
   - Store in `resume_job_matches` table
   - Update match scores

3. **Match API** (1 day)
   - `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/matches` - Get matched resumes for a job
   - `GET /api/resumes/{resume_id}/matches` - Get matched jobs for a resume
   - `POST /api/resumes/{resume_id}/match` - Manually trigger matching
   - Sort by match score

4. **Minimal UI** (1 day)
   - Show match score badge on candidate cards
   - List top 5 matches for each job
   - Simple table with scores
   - Filter by minimum match score

#### Database Changes:
```sql
CREATE TABLE resume_job_matches (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    resume_id UUID REFERENCES resumes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    job_id UUID REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    match_score INT CHECK (match_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    skill_score INT CHECK (skill_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    experience_score INT CHECK (experience_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    education_score INT CHECK (education_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    matched_skills TEXT[], -- Array of matched skills
    missing_skills TEXT[], -- Array of missing skills
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(resume_id, job_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_resume_job_matches_resume ON resume_job_matches(resume_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_resume_job_matches_job ON resume_job_matches(job_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_resume_job_matches_score ON resume_job_matches(match_score DESC);
```

#### API Endpoints to Create:
```python
# In api/v1/matching.py (new file)
POST   /api/v1/matching/match-resume/{resume_id}  # Trigger matching for one resume
POST   /api/v1/matching/match-job/{job_id}        # Match all resumes to one job
GET    /api/v1/matching/resume/{resume_id}/matches  # Get job matches for resume
GET    /api/v1/matching/job/{job_id}/matches       # Get resume matches for job
DELETE /api/v1/matching/{match_id}                 # Delete a match
```

#### Matching Algorithm Logic:
```python
def calculate_match_score(resume, job):
    # 1. Skill Matching (40% weight)
    resume_skills = set(resume.skills.lower().split(','))
    job_skills = set(job.required_skills.lower().split(','))
    matched_skills = resume_skills & job_skills
    skill_score = (len(matched_skills) / len(job_skills)) * 100 if job_skills else 0
    
    # 2. Experience Matching (30% weight)
    resume_years = extract_years_of_experience(resume)
    job_min_years = job.min_experience_years or 0
    job_max_years = job.max_experience_years or 100
    if job_min_years <= resume_years <= job_max_years:
        experience_score = 100
    elif resume_years < job_min_years:
        experience_score = (resume_years / job_min_years) * 100
    else:
        experience_score = max(0, 100 - ((resume_years - job_max_years) * 10))
    
    # 3. Education Matching (30% weight)
    education_levels = {'high_school': 1, 'bachelors': 2, 'masters': 3, 'phd': 4}
    resume_level = education_levels.get(resume.education_level, 0)
    job_level = education_levels.get(job.required_education, 0)
    education_score = min(100, (resume_level / job_level) * 100) if job_level else 100
    
    # 4. Composite Score
    match_score = (
        skill_score * 0.4 +
        experience_score * 0.3 +
        education_score * 0.3
    )
    
    return {
        'match_score': int(match_score),
        'skill_score': int(skill_score),
        'experience_score': int(experience_score),
        'education_score': int(education_score),
        'matched_skills': list(matched_skills),
        'missing_skills': list(job_skills - resume_skills)
    }
```

**Deliverable:** Auto-match resumes to jobs, display scores, filter by score
