# LinkedIn Scoring Weight Update

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**Impact:** HIGH - LinkedIn now critical for overall score  

---

## üéØ Problem

User reported that candidates without LinkedIn were still getting 80% overall score, which is not ideal since LinkedIn presence is critical in modern hiring.

**Example:**
- LinkedIn Score: 20% (missing)
- Overall Score: 80% ‚ùå **Too high!**

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### New Scoring Weights

| Criteria | Old Weight | New Weight | Change |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **LinkedIn Profile** | 15% | **35%** | +20% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |
| Font Consistency | 20% | 15% | -5% |
| Grammar Quality | 20% | 15% | -5% |
| Formatting | 15% | 10% | -5% |
| Content Patterns | 10% | 8% | -2% |
| Structure | 10% | 7% | -3% |
| Capitalization | 10% | 10% | 0% |

**LinkedIn is now the MOST IMPORTANT factor (35% weight)**

### Additional Penalty

**If LinkedIn score < 30%:**
- Apply up to 20% additional penalty
- Penalty scales with how low the LinkedIn score is
- Formula: `penalty = (30 - linkedin_score) / 30 * 0.20`

**Examples:**
- LinkedIn = 0%: Penalty = 20%
- LinkedIn = 20%: Penalty = 6.7%
- LinkedIn = 30%: No penalty
