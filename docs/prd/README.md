git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

## üìù PRD Guidelines

### When to Create a Detailed PRD
- Before starting implementation of any feature
- When breaking down high-level features into sub-features
- When significant changes are needed to existing features

### PRD Structure
Each detailed PRD should include:
1. **Overview** - Feature description and goals
2. **User Stories** - Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
3. **Technical Requirements** - Architecture, APIs, database schema
4. **UI/UX Specifications** - Wireframes, mockups, user flows
5. **Success Metrics** - How to measure success
6. **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
7. **Deployment Plan** - Rollout strategy and monitoring

### PRD Naming Convention
```
XX-FEATURE_NAME_PRD.md

Where:
- XX = Feature number (01-10)
- FEATURE_NAME = Descriptive name in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Examples: 02-RESUME_UPLOAD_PRD.md, 07-AI_MATCHING_PRD.md
```
