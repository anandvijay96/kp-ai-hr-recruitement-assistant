## üéØ Creation Strategy

### Approach 1: Sequential (Recommended)
Create PRDs one at a time, in phase order:
1. Feature 3 (Filter)
2. Feature 4 (Tracking)
3. Feature 5 (Rating)
4. Feature 6 (Job Creation)
5. Feature 7 (AI Matching)
6. Feature 8 (Dashboard)
7. Feature 9 (Ranking)
8. Feature 10 (User Management)

**Pros:**
- Can refine approach as we go
- Learn from previous PRDs
- Adjust based on feedback

**Cons:**
- Takes longer to have complete picture
- May need to revise earlier PRDs

### Approach 2: Parallel (Faster)
Create all PRDs simultaneously in batches:
- Batch 1: Features 3-5 (Phase 1-2)
- Batch 2: Features 6-8 (Phase 3)
- Batch 3: Features 9-10 (Phase 4)

**Pros:**
- Complete picture faster
- Can see dependencies clearly
- Start implementation sooner

**Cons:**
- More work upfront
- May need revisions
- Harder to maintain consistency

### Approach 3: Hybrid (Balanced) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
Create detailed PRDs for Phase 1, lighter PRDs for later phases:
- **Detailed:** Features 2-3 (Phase 1) - Full 20-30 pages
- **Medium:** Features 4-6 (Phase 2-3) - 15-20 pages
- **Light:** Features 7-10 (Phase 3-4) - 10-15 pages

Then refine later PRDs as we approach implementation.

**Pros:**
- Balance between detail and speed
- Can start Phase 1 immediately
- Flexibility for later phases

**Cons:**
- Need to revisit later PRDs
- Some uncertainty in later phases

## üìä Estimated Effort

### Time to Create PRDs

| Feature | Complexity | Estimated Time | Status |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------|
| 02 - Resume Upload | High | 6-8 hours | ‚úÖ Done |
| 03 - Resume Filter | Medium | 4-6 hours | Pending |
| 04 - Candidate Tracking | High | 6-8 hours | Pending |
| 05 - Resume Rating | Low | 3-4 hours | Pending |
| 06 - Job Creation | Medium | 4-6 hours | Pending |
| 07 - AI Matching | High | 6-8 hours | Pending |
| 08 - Jobs Dashboard | Medium | 4-6 hours | Pending |
| 09 - Resume Ranking | Medium | 4-6 hours | Pending |
| 10 - User Management | High | 6-8 hours | Pending |

**Total:** 43-60 hours (~1-1.5 weeks of focused work)

## üîÑ Workflow

### For Each PRD:

1. **Research** (30 min)
   - Review high-level PRD
   - Check dependencies
   - Review similar features

2. **Structure** (30 min)
   - Create outline
   - Define user stories
   - List requirements

3. **Write** (3-5 hours)
   - Fill in all sections
   - Create database schema
   - Define APIs
   - Draw UI wireframes

4. **Review** (30 min)
   - Check completeness
   - Verify consistency
   - Add examples

5. **Refine** (30 min)
   - Fix issues
   - Add missing details
   - Update cross-references

**Total per PRD:** 5-7 hours

## üìã Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Sequential
"Let's create Feature 3 PRD next (Resume Filtering)"

### Option B: Create All at Once
"Create all remaining PRDs in one go"

### Option C: Batch Creation
"Create PRDs for Phase 1 first (Features 2-3), then Phase 2"

### Option D: Custom
"Let me know which features you want PRDs for first"

---

## üí° Recommendation

**I recommend Option C (Batch Creation):**

1. **Now:** Complete Phase 1 PRDs
   - ‚úÖ Feature 2: Resume Upload (Done)
   - ‚è≥ Feature 3: Resume Filter (Next)

2. **After Phase 1 PRDs:** Start implementation
   - Begin coding Feature 2
   - Refine PRDs based on learnings

3. **During Phase 1 Implementation:** Create Phase 2 PRDs
   - Feature 4: Candidate Tracking
   - Feature 5: Resume Rating

4. **Continue pattern** for remaining phases

This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Immediate actionable PRDs
- ‚úÖ Time to refine approach
- ‚úÖ Flexibility to adjust
- ‚úÖ Can start coding sooner

## üéØ Your Decision

**What would you like to do?**

A) Create Feature 3 PRD next (Resume Filtering)
B) Create all remaining PRDs now (8 PRDs)
C) Create Phase 1 PRDs only (Feature 3)
D) Something else

**Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly!**

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ High-level planning complete
- ‚úÖ Tech stack defined
- ‚úÖ Feature 2 PRD complete (20+ pages)
