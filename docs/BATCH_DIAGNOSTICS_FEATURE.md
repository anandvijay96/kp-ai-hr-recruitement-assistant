            data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#batchDiagnostics${index}">
        🔍 View Detailed Diagnostics
    </button>
</div>

<!-- Detailed Diagnostics Collapse for Batch Item -->
<div class="collapse mt-3" id="batchDiagnostics${index}">
    <div class="card card-body">
        ${generateDiagnosticsHTML(result.authenticity_score?.diagnostics || {})}
