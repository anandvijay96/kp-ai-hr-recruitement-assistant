## 🆕 Latest Changes (Final Session)

### **Issue: Job Hopping Shows 0 Data**

**Root Cause:** LLM not extracting work experience from complex resume templates

**Solution:** Instead of trying to handle every edge case, we now:
1. **Detect extraction failures** (0 jobs, unknown career level + template flag)
2. **Show manual review warning** with clear explanation
3. **Provide view resume buttons** for HR to manually verify

### **Implementation:**

**Manual Review Warning:**
```html
⚠️ Manual Review Required

Data extraction failed due to unusual resume format or template usage.

This resume requires manual verification as automated analysis could not 
extract work experience, education, or other critical information. 
Please review the original resume document.

[View Resume in New Tab] [View Resume in Popup]

Why this happened: The resume uses a complex template or unusual formatting 
that prevents automated data extraction. You should manually verify all 
information before approving.
```

**View Resume Options:**
1. **New Tab:** Opens formatted HTML view with extracted text
2. **Popup Modal:** Shows resume in modal dialog
3. **Always Available:** Button shown on all job hopping sections
