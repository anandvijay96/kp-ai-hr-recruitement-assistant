## üéØ PRD Creation Prompts

### **üìù Prompt 1: Create Complete PRD**
```
You are a senior product manager creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new feature in our HR recruitment application.

Create a detailed PRD for: [FEATURE NAME]

Structure the PRD with these sections:

1. OVERVIEW
   - Brief description of what this feature does
   - Problem statement it solves
   - Target users (recruiters, admins, etc.)

2. USER STORIES
   - Write 3-5 user stories in "As a... I want... So that..." format
   - Each story should be specific and testable

3. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
   - List specific, measurable criteria for each user story
   - Include both functional and non-functional requirements

4. TECHNICAL DESIGN
   - Database schema (tables, columns, relationships)
   - API endpoints needed (HTTP methods, paths, request/response)
   - UI components and user flow
   - Integration points with existing system

5. DEPENDENCIES
   - External libraries or services needed
   - Internal modules that need modification
   - Any prerequisites

6. TESTING PLAN
   - Unit tests needed
   - Integration tests needed
   - Manual testing scenarios
   - Edge cases to consider

7. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
   - Break down into 2-3 phases with specific tasks
   - Estimate effort for each phase
   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies

8. SUCCESS METRICS
   - How we'll measure if this feature is successful
   - Key performance indicators

Make this PRD comprehensive but actionable - detailed enough for a developer to implement from, but not overwhelming.
```

### **üìù Prompt 2: Technical Implementation Planning**
```
You are a senior software architect planning the technical implementation for a new feature in our HR application.

   - Define service methods and their responsibilities
   - Specify business logic implementation

4. UI/UX DESIGN
   - Describe the user interface components
   - Specify templates and static files needed
   - Define user interactions and flows

5. INTEGRATION POINTS
   - How this feature integrates with existing modules
   - What existing APIs or services it uses
   - Any modifications needed to current codebase

6. FILE STRUCTURE
   - List all new files to be created
   - Specify which existing files need modification
   - Suggest file organization

7. TESTING STRATEGY
   - Unit tests for services and utilities
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Manual testing checklist

8. DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
   - Any special deployment requirements
   - Environment variables or configuration needed
   - Migration scripts if database changes

Focus on making this implementable - provide concrete examples of code structure, API responses, and database queries.
```

### **üìù Prompt 3: Code Implementation**

## üõ†Ô∏è Working with AI Development Tools

### **For Cursor/Windsurf Users:**

#### **üîß Setup Prompt**
```
Set up my development environment for implementing a new feature:

1. Current branch: [BRANCH NAME]
2. Feature: [FEATURE NAME]
3. Project structure: FastAPI with Jinja2 templates

Help me:
- Verify I'm on the correct branch
- Set up the file structure for this feature
- Create any necessary directories
- Check current project dependencies
- Start the development server for testing
```

#### **üìÅ File Creation Prompt**
```
Create the necessary files for implementing [FEATURE NAME]:

Based on the PRD, I need these files:
- Models: [list database models]
- Services: [list service classes]
- API endpoints: [list API routes]
- Templates: [list HTML templates]
- Tests: [list test files]

For each file, create the basic structure with:
- Proper imports
- Class/function definitions
- Type hints
- Docstrings
- Basic error handling

Start with the most fundamental files (models first, then services, then API, then UI).
```

#### **‚ö° Quick Implementation Prompt**
```
Implement the core functionality for [FEATURE NAME]:

Using the PRD specifications, implement:
1. Database models with proper relationships
2. Service methods with business logic
3. API endpoints with validation
4. Basic HTML templates

Focus on getting the core functionality working first, then we can enhance and polish. Include proper error handling and logging throughout.
```

#### **üß™ Testing Prompt**
```
Create comprehensive tests for the [FEATURE NAME] implementation:

Write tests for:
- All service methods
- All API endpoints
- Database operations
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases

Use pytest conventions and ensure good test coverage. Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate.
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Issue 1: Branch Conflicts**
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# If conflicts occur:
# 1. Open conflicted files
# 2. Look for <<<<<<< HEAD markers
# 3. Resolve conflicts manually
# 4. Stage resolved files
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts"
```

#### **Issue 2: Tests Failing**
```bash
# Run tests to see what's failing
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Check specific failing test
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_specific.py::test_function -v

# Fix the issues and run again
```

#### **Issue 3: Import Errors**
```bash
# Check if dependencies are installed
uv sync

# Verify Python path and imports
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

# Check for circular imports
# Look for import statements in files
```
