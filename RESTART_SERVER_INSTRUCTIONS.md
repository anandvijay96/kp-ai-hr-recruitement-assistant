# 🚨 CRITICAL: Server Restart Required

## The Problem

The vendor routes have been added to `main.py`, but **the server is still running with the old code**. FastAPI needs to be restarted to load the new routes.

## ✅ Solution: Restart the Server

### Step 1: Stop the Current Server

In your terminal where the server is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server

### Step 2: Restart the Server

Run this command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Step 3: Verify It's Working

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000/vendors
```

You should now see the vendor management page with:
- Dashboard statistics
- Filter options
- "Create Vendor" button

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Routes Are Loaded

### Method 1: Check FastAPI Docs
Go to: http://localhost:8000/docs

You should see all vendor endpoints listed under "Vendor Management"

### Method 2: Check Server Logs
When the server starts, you should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
INFO:     Application startup complete
```

### Method 3: Test the Route Directly
Open: http://localhost:8000/vendors

- ✅ **Success**: You see the vendor list page
- ❌ **Still failing**: See troubleshooting below

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Not Found" Error Still Appears

**Cause**: Server wasn't restarted or changes didn't save

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you stopped the server (Ctrl+C)
2. Verify `main.py` has the vendor routes:
   ```bash
   grep -n "Vendor Management Web Pages" main.py
   ```
3. Restart the server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

### Issue 2: "Internal Server Error" (500)

**Cause**: Database tables not created or other runtime error

**Solution**:
1. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   python migrations/012_add_vendor_management_tables.py
   ```
2. Check server logs for detailed error message
3. Restart the server

### Issue 3: Server Won't Start

**Cause**: Syntax error in main.py or import error

**Solution**:
1. Check the error message in the terminal
2. Look for syntax errors or missing imports
3. Verify all files are saved

### Issue 4: "Template Not Found" Error

**Cause**: Template files missing

**Solution**:
1. Verify templates exist:
   ```bash
   ls templates/vendors/
   ```
   Should show: `list.html`, `create.html`, `detail.html`, `edit.html`
2. If missing, they need to be recreated

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Before accessing http://localhost:8000/vendors:

- [ ] Server has been stopped (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] `main.py` contains vendor routes (check line 903-922)
- [ ] All 4 vendor templates exist in `templates/vendors/`
- [ ] Database migration has been run
- [ ] Server has been restarted with `uvicorn main:app --reload`
- [ ] Server started without errors

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Restart

### Vendor List Page (http://localhost:8000/vendors)

Should display:
- ✅ Dashboard with 4 statistics cards
- ✅ Filter dropdowns (Status, Category)
- ✅ Search box
- ✅ "Add Vendor" button
- ✅ Message "No vendors found" (if database is empty)

### Create Vendor Page (http://localhost:8000/vendors/create)

Should display:
- ✅ Form with all vendor fields
- ✅ Vendor manager dropdown
- ✅ "Create Vendor" button

### API Endpoints (http://localhost:8000/docs)

Should show:
- ✅ 14 vendor-related endpoints
- ✅ All under "Vendor Management" tag

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Server Restart

1. **Test the vendor list page**: http://localhost:8000/vendors
2. **Create a test vendor**: Click "Add Vendor"
3. **View vendor details**: Click "View" on a vendor
4. **Edit vendor**: Click "Edit" on a vendor

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Auto-reload**: If you started with `--reload`, the server should auto-restart when files change. But sometimes it doesn't detect all changes, so manual restart is safer.

- **Port conflicts**: If you get "Address already in use", another process is using port 8000. Either:
  - Kill the old process
  - Use a different port: `uvicorn main:app --port 8001 --reload`

- **Cache issues**: If the browser shows old content, do a hard refresh:
  - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
  - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If the vendor page still doesn't work after restarting:

1. **Check the terminal logs** for error messages
2. **Open browser console** (F12) to see JavaScript errors
3. **Verify the route** by going to http://localhost:8000/docs and looking for `/vendors` endpoint
4. **Check if other pages work** (like http://localhost:8000/clients)

If other pages work but vendors don't, there may be a specific issue with the vendor code that needs debugging.
