## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot create users

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're logged in as an admin
- Check that the email is unique
- Verify the migration ran successfully

### Issue: Cannot change role

**Solution:**
- You cannot change your own role
- Cannot remove the last admin
- Ensure you have `user.manage` permission

### Issue: Dashboard not loading

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API token is valid
- Ensure `/api/users` endpoint is accessible

### Issue: Migration fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if tables already exist
sqlite3 hr_recruitment.db ".schema user_roles"

# If tables exist, migration already ran
# If not, check for SQL syntax errors in migration file
```

## üìä Monitoring

### View Audit Logs

```bash
# Check user audit logs
sqlite3 hr_recruitment.db "SELECT * FROM user_audit_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Check specific user's audit trail
sqlite3 hr_recruitment.db "SELECT action_type, performed_by, timestamp FROM user_audit_log WHERE target_user_id = 'USER_ID';"
```

### Check Active Users

```bash
sqlite3 hr_recruitment.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE status = 'active';"
```

### View User Statistics

```bash
# Users by role
sqlite3 hr_recruitment.db "SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;"

# Users by status
sqlite3 hr_recruitment.db "SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY status;"
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Always provide a reason** when changing roles or deactivating users
2. **Use bulk operations** for managing multiple users (when implemented)
3. **Review audit logs regularly** for security monitoring
4. **Maintain at least 2 active admins** for redundancy
5. **Deactivate users immediately** when they leave the organization
6. **Use strong passwords** - the system auto-generates secure ones
7. **Assign appropriate roles** - follow principle of least privilege
