## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

**New File:**
- `services/resume_parser_service.py` - Complete resume parsing logic

**Modified Files:**
- `services/resume_service.py` - Integrated parser into upload flow

## 📊 Parsing Capabilities

### Supported File Formats
- ✅ **PDF** - Using PyPDF2
- ✅ **DOCX** - Using python-docx
- ✅ **TXT** - Direct text reading

### Pattern Recognition

**Email Detection:**
```regex
\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b
```

**Phone Detection:**
```regex
(?:\+?\d{1,3}[-.\s]?)?\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}
```

**LinkedIn Detection:**
```regex
(?:https?://)?(?:www\.)?linkedin\.com/in/[\w-]+
```

**Skills Detection:**
- Searches for common tech skills in skills section
- Supports 50+ popular technologies
- Case-insensitive matching

## 🎯 Usage

### Automatic Parsing

When you upload a resume, parsing happens automatically:

1. Go to http://localhost:8000/resumes/upload-new
2. Upload a resume file
3. System automatically:
   - Extracts text
   - Parses all sections
   - Saves structured data
   - Updates candidate fields

### Viewing Parsed Data

1. Go to http://localhost:8000/resumes
2. Click the **View** (eye icon) button on any resume
3. See all parsed information in the modal:
   - Personal info
   - LinkedIn/GitHub links
   - Skills (as badges)
   - Education (as list)
   - Experience (as list)
   - Certifications (as list)
   - Total experience years

---

## 📝 Database Storage

### Parsed Data Structure (JSON)

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
  "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
  "github": "https://github.com/johndoe",
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "Bachelor of Technology",
      "year": "2020"
    }
  ],
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "Software Engineer",
      "company": "Tech Corp"
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    "Python",
    "JavaScript",
    "React",
    "AWS"
  ],
  "certifications": [
    "AWS Certified Developer",
    "Scrum Master Certification"
  ],
  "summary": "Experienced software engineer...",
  "total_experience_years": 5,
  "extracted_text": "Full resume text...",
  "parsed_at": "2025-10-03T12:00:00"
}
```

### Database Fields Updated

- `candidate_name` - Auto-filled from parsed name
- `candidate_email` - Auto-filled from parsed email
- `candidate_phone` - Auto-filled from parsed phone
- `extracted_text` - First 5000 characters of resume
- `parsed_data` - Complete JSON structure above
- `status` - Set to "parsed" if data extracted successfully

---

## 🔍 Parsing Logic

### Name Extraction
1. Looks for "Name:" pattern in first 10 lines
2. If not found, assumes first non-header line is the name
3. Validates name length (2-5 words)

### Section Detection
- Uses keyword matching to find sections
- Education keywords: "education", "academic", "degree", etc.
- Experience keywords: "experience", "employment", "work history", etc.
- Skills keywords: "skills", "technical skills", "expertise", etc.

### Smart Extraction
- Extracts next 10-15 lines after section header
- Uses regex patterns for structured data
- Limits results to prevent data overload
- Handles missing sections gracefully

## 🎨 UI Display

The parsed data is beautifully displayed in the view modal:

**Personal Info Section:**
- Name, Email, Phone displayed prominently
- LinkedIn and GitHub as clickable links
