## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)

```bash
# Resume Upload Settings
RESUME_UPLOAD_DIR=uploads/resumes
MAX_RESUME_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB in bytes
ALLOWED_RESUME_FORMATS=.pdf,.docx,.txt
```

### Default Settings

- **Upload Directory:** `uploads/resumes`
- **Max File Size:** 10MB
- **Allowed Formats:** PDF, DOCX, TXT
- **Bulk Upload Limit:** 50 files
- **File Organization:** `/{year}/{month}/{user_id}/{resume_id}.ext`

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Database Migration

The new tables will be created automatically on first run via SQLAlchemy's `init_db()` function.

**Tables Created:**
- `resumes`
- `resume_upload_history`
- `bulk_upload_sessions`

### 2. Upload Directory Setup

The upload directory is created automatically when the FileStorageService initializes.

### 3. Access the Features

**Resume List:**
```
http://localhost:8000/resumes
```

**Upload New Resume:**
```
http://localhost:8000/resumes/upload-new
```

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/resumes/upload
GET    /api/resumes
GET    /api/resumes/{id}
GET    /api/resumes/{id}/download
DELETE /api/resumes/{id}
POST   /api/resumes/check-duplicate
POST   /api/resumes/bulk-upload
GET    /api/resumes/bulk-upload/{id}/status
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required:** All endpoints require JWT authentication

3. **File Validation:** 
   - Format validation (PDF, DOCX, TXT only)
   - Size validation (max 10MB)
   - Null byte detection
4. **Filename Sanitization:** Prevents path traversal attacks
5. **Duplicate Detection:** SHA-256 hash-based
6. **Soft Delete:** Resumes are marked as deleted, not physically removed
7. **Audit Trail:** All operations logged in `resume_upload_history`

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Virus Scanning:** Currently disabled (returns "clean" by default)
   - To enable: Implement ClamAV integration in future
   
2. **Resume Parsing:** Not yet implemented
   - Status remains "uploaded" instead of "parsed"
   - `parsed_data` field is empty
   
3. **Bulk Upload:** Session tracking created but file-level tracking not fully implemented
   - Individual file status in bulk upload needs enhancement
   
4. **Cloud Storage:** Currently uses local filesystem
   - For production: Implement S3/Azure Blob Storage

---

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

1. **Virus Scanning Integration**
   - Integrate ClamAV for actual virus scanning
   - Add virus scan result notifications

2. **Resume Parsing**
   - Extract text from PDFs/DOCX
   - Parse candidate information (skills, experience, education)
   - Populate `parsed_data` JSON field

3. **Advanced Duplicate Handling**
   - Implement version management
   - Allow replacing existing resumes
   - Track resume versions

4. **Cloud Storage**
   - S3/Azure Blob Storage integration
   - CDN for faster downloads
   - Automatic backup

5. **Advanced Search**
   - Full-text search in resume content
   - Search by skills, experience
   - Advanced filters

6. **Bulk Operations**
   - Bulk delete
   - Bulk status update
   - Bulk export

7. **Analytics**
   - Upload statistics
