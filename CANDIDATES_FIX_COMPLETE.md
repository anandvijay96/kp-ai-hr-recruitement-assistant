# ✅ Candidates Not Showing - FIXED!

**Problem:** After vetting and uploading resumes, no candidates appear on candidates page  
**Root Cause:** Only Resume records were created, not Candidate records  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Commit:** `1d82053`

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

When uploading approved resumes from vetting:
- ❌ Created Resume record only
- ❌ No Candidate record created
- ❌ Candidates page had nothing to show

---

## ✅ The Fix

Now when uploading vetted resumes:

```python
# 1. Extract candidate info from parsed data
candidate_name = extracted_data.get('name', 'Unknown Candidate')
candidate_email = extracted_data.get('email')
candidate_phone = extracted_data.get('phone')

# 2. Check if candidate exists (by email)
if candidate_email:
    existing_candidate = db.query(Candidate).filter_by(email=candidate_email).first()

# 3. Create new candidate if doesn't exist
if not existing_candidate:
    candidate = Candidate(
        full_name=candidate_name,
        email=candidate_email,
        phone=candidate_phone,
        source="vetting",
        status="new"
    )
    db.add(candidate)
    db.commit()

# 4. Link Resume to Candidate
resume = Resume(
    ...
    candidate_id=candidate.id,  # ✅ Link established
    candidate_name=candidate_name,
    candidate_email=candidate_email
)
```

## 🎯 What Happens Now

### Data Flow

```
Vetting Page
  ↓
Approve Resume
  ↓
Extract Data (name, email, phone)
  ↓
Check if Candidate Exists (by email)
  ↓
Create New Candidate ✅ (if doesn't exist)
  ↓
Create Resume Record ✅ (linked to candidate)
  ↓
Candidates Page Shows Both! 🎉
```

### Duplicate Prevention

- **Email-based deduplication:** If same email, uses existing candidate
- **Prevents duplicate candidates** from multiple resume uploads
- **Links multiple resumes** to same candidate if needed

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### After Upload

**Candidates Table:**
| Name | Email | Phone | Source | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| John Doe | john@email.com | +1-234-5678 | vetting | new |
| Jane Smith | jane@email.com | +1-987-6543 | vetting | new |

**Resumes Table:**
| File | Candidate | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| john_resume.pdf | John Doe | uploaded |
| jane_resume.pdf | Jane Smith | uploaded |

**Link:** Each resume is linked to its candidate via `candidate_id`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still Not Seeing Candidates?

**1. Check Server Logs**
Look for:
```
INFO: Created new candidate: John Doe (ID: abc123)
INFO: Uploaded approved resume: john_resume.pdf (ID: xyz789)
```

**2. Check Database**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM candidates;
-- Should be > 0 after upload

SELECT full_name, email, source FROM candidates;
-- Should show your uploaded candidates
```

**3. Check Resume Data**
Make sure the resume has extractable data:
- Name should be present
- Email is used for deduplication
- Phone is optional

**4. Check Filter Settings**
On candidates page, try "Reset Filters" button to clear any active filters.
