### Access API Documentation
Go to: **http://localhost:8000/docs**

### Test API Endpoints

#### **1. Create Client** - `POST /api/clients`
```json
{
  "name": "Test Corporation Inc.",
  "industry": "Technology",
  "website": "https://testcorp.com",
  "address": "123 Test Street",
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "state": "CA",
  "country": "USA",
  "postal_code": "94102",
  "account_manager_id": "temp-manager-id",
  "contacts": [

sqlite3 hr_recruitment.db ".tables"
```

**Expected Output:** Should include:
- `clients`
- `client_contacts`
- `client_communications`
- `client_feedback`
- `client_job_assignments`
- `client_analytics`

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Temporary Limitations
1. **Authentication Disabled**: All auth checks temporarily removed for testing
2. **Mock Account Manager**: Uses placeholder "temp-manager-id"
3. **No File Uploads**: Logo and attachment uploads not implemented yet
4. **Incomplete Forms**: Some forms show "coming soon" alerts

### Expected Behavior
1. **Empty Data**: New installations will have no clients - this is normal
2. **First Use**: Need to create at least one user before creating clients
3. **Stats Show Zero**: Normal for new clients with no activity

### Not Yet Implemented
1. Edit client form (button shows alert)
2. Delete client
3. Log communication form
4. Submit feedback form
5. Add contact after creation form
6. Link job form
7. Export to PDF/CSV
8. Bulk operations

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Not Found" Error
**Solution**: Restart the server after code changes

### Issue: "No clients found"
**Solution**: This is normal - create your first client

### Issue: "No users found" when creating client
**Solution**: Create a user first via `/users` page

### Issue: API returns 500 error
**Solution**: Check server logs for details, verify database is accessible

### Issue: Empty stats (all zeros)
**Solution**: Normal for new clients - stats populate as you add jobs and candidates

### Issue: Filters don't work
**Solution**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
