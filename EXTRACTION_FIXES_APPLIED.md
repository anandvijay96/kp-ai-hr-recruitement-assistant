---

## ‚úÖ **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Fixed Education Extraction (CRITICAL)**

**Problem:** Regex patterns like `r"A\.?A\.?"` and `r"M\.?A\.?"` were matching random substrings:
- "aShivaShankar" matched as Associate degree
- "mail" matched as Master's degree
- "ashankar", "asthan", "MARY", "ment" all matched incorrectly

**Solution:** Added word boundaries (`\b`) to all degree patterns:
```python
'bachelor': [
    r"\bB\.?\s*S\.?\b(?:\s+in\s+)?([\w\s]+)?",  # Added \b
    r"\bB\.?\s*A\.?\b(?:\s+in\s+)?([\w\s]+)?",  # Added \b
    r"\bBachelor['']?s?\s+(?:of\s+)?(?:Science|Arts|Engineering)\b",  # Added \b
]
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Only valid degrees extracted (e.g., "Bachelor of Engineering")

---

### **2. Fixed Location Extraction**

**Problem:** Extracting wrong location:
- "Naukri Natikala, ShivaShankar" instead of "Pilani, Rajasthan"
- "Pilani, s" (truncated)
- Capturing extra text after location

**Solution:** 
- Added `(?:\n|$)` to stop at newline
- Improved "Location:" label detection
- Better filtering of false positives

```python
location_match = re.search(r'Location:?\s*([A-Z][a-z]+(?:[\s,]+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)(?:\n|$)', text, re.IGNORECASE)
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ "Pilani, Rajasthan" extracted correctly

---

### **3. Fixed Work Experience Company Extraction**

**Problem:** Companies without keywords (like "Accenture") showing as `None`

**Solution:**
- Added more company keywords: 'services', 'systems', 'solutions', 'group', 'consulting'
- Fallback logic: if no keywords found, use line before title
- Validation to ensure it's not a section header or bullet point

```python
has_company_keyword = any(keyword in check_line.lower() for keyword in [
    'inc', 'ltd', 'llc', 'corp', 'company', 'technologies', 'corporation', 
    'services', 'systems', 'solutions', 'group', 'consulting'
])
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ All companies extracted: "Accenture", "XYZ Company", "ABC Tech"

---

### **4. Fixed Work Experience in Education Section**

**Problem:** Education dates (2012 - 2016) being extracted as work experience with "BITS Pilani" as company

**Solution:** Added education section detection to skip work experience extraction in education sections

```python
education_indicators = ['education', 'academic', 'qualifications', 'degree', 'university', 'college', 'school']
in_education_section = False

# Skip work experience extraction when in education section
if in_education_section:
    i += 1
    continue
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Only 3 valid work experiences extracted (removed fake BITS Pilani entry)

---

### **5. Fixed Education Field of Study Extraction**

**Problem:** Field showing as "Engineering" instead of "Computer Science", or institution showing as field

**Solution:** Check next line for field of study if not in degree match

```python
# If no field found, check next line (common format: degree on one line, field on next)
if not degree_info['field_of_study'] and i + 1 < len(lines):
    next_line = lines[i + 1].strip()
    if next_line and not any(keyword in next_line_lower for keyword in self.institution_keywords):
        if not re.search(r'\d{4}', next_line):  # Not a year
            if len(next_line) < 50:  # Reasonable length
                degree_info['field_of_study'] = next_line
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ "Computer Science" extracted correctly as field

---

### **6. Fixed Education Institution Extraction**

**Problem:** Institution showing as "Computer Science" instead of "BITS Pilani"

**Solution:** 
- Skip the field of study line when looking for institution
- Check for institution keywords
- Validate it's not the same as field of study

```python
# Skip field of study line if used
start_j = i + 2 if degree_info['field_of_study'] and degree_info['field_of_study'] == lines[i + 1].strip() else i + 1

for j in range(start_j, min(i + 5, len(lines))):
    check_line = lines[j].strip()
    if any(keyword in check_line_lower for keyword in self.institution_keywords):
        degree_info['institution'] = check_line
        break
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ "BITS Pilani" extracted correctly as institution

---

### **7. Fixed Education Years Extraction**

**Problem:** Years showing as "None - None" instead of "2012 - 2016"

**Solution:** Increased context window from 3 to 5 lines

```python
# Look for years in current and next 4 lines
context = ' '.join(lines[i:min(i + 5, len(lines))])
years = re.findall(r'\b((?:19|20)\d{2})\b', context)
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ "2012 - 2016" extracted correctly

---

### **8. Added Projects and Languages to API**

**Problem:** Projects and languages not being returned by API endpoint

**Solution:** Added selectinload for projects and languages relationships

```python
stmt = select(Candidate).options(
    selectinload(Candidate.resumes),
    selectinload(Candidate.skills).selectinload(CandidateSkill.skill),
    selectinload(Candidate.education),
    selectinload(Candidate.work_experience),
    selectinload(Candidate.certifications),
    selectinload(Candidate.projects),  # Added
    selectinload(Candidate.languages)  # Added
).filter(Candidate.id == candidate_id)
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Projects and languages now returned in API response
