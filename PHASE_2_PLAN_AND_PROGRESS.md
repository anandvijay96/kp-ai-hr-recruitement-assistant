## üîç DAY 1-2 DETAILED PROGRESS

### **Open-Resume Analysis**

#### **Repository Information:**
- **URL:** https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume
- **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, React, NextJS 13, PDF.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Parsing Approach:** 4-step pipeline (Read PDF ‚Üí Group into lines ‚Üí Group into sections ‚Üí Extract fields)
- **Key Features:** Feature scoring system, Bold + ALL CAPS section detection, Subsection handling

#### **Analysis Checklist:**
- [x] Clone repository ‚úÖ
- [x] Review architecture ‚úÖ
- [x] Study parsing algorithms ‚úÖ
- [x] Analyze section detection ‚úÖ
- [x] Review entity extraction ‚úÖ
- [ ] Test with sample resumes
- [ ] Document integration plan

#### **Findings:**

**1. Parsing Pipeline (4 Steps):**
```
Step 1: readPdf() ‚Üí Extract text items with position data
Step 2: groupTextItemsIntoLines() ‚Üí Merge adjacent text using char width
Step 3: groupLinesIntoSections() ‚Üí Detect section titles (BOLD + UPPERCASE)
Step 4: extractResumeFromSections() ‚Üí Use feature scoring for fields
```

**2. Key Innovations:**

**A. Intelligent Line Grouping:**
- Calculates "typical character width" based on common font/height
- Merges adjacent text items if distance < typical char width
- Handles space insertion intelligently (after colons, bullet points)
- Filters noise from poorly formatted PDFs

**B. Section Detection (Much Better Than Ours!):**
- **Primary:** Bold + ALL CAPS text = section title
- **Fallback:** Keyword matching + formatting rules
- Section keywords: experience, education, project, skill, summary, etc.
- First 2 lines assumed to be profile (name, contact)

**C. Feature Scoring System (REVOLUTIONARY!):**
Instead of simple regex, they score each text item:
```typescript
// Example: Email detection
EMAIL_FEATURE_SETS = [
  [matchEmail, +4, true],        // Has @xxx.xxx pattern
  [isBold, -1],                  // Penalize if bold (likely name)
  [hasParenthesis, -4],          // Penalize if has () (likely phone)
  [hasComma, -4],                // Penalize if has , (likely location)
  [hasSlash, -4],                // Penalize if has / (likely URL)
]
```

Each field has:
- Positive features (what it SHOULD have)
- Negative features (what it SHOULD NOT have)
- Highest scoring item wins

**D. Work Experience Subsection Handling:**
- Divides experience section into subsections (each job)
- Detects job title using whitelist of 60+ common titles
- Extracts date using date patterns
- Company = what's left after excluding job title & date
- Bullet points extracted separately

**E. Professional Summary:**
- Checks for dedicated "Summary" or "Objective" section
- Fallback: Extract from profile if has 4+ words
- Prefers dedicated section over profile summary

#### **Techniques to Integrate:**

**Priority 1 (High Impact):**
1. ‚úÖ **Feature Scoring System** - Replace simple regex with scored features
2. ‚úÖ **Section Detection via Formatting** - Use Bold + ALL CAPS detection
3. ‚úÖ **Intelligent Line Merging** - Calculate typical char width
4. ‚úÖ **Subsection Division** - Better structured data extraction

**Priority 2 (Medium Impact):**
5. ‚úÖ **Job Title Whitelist** - Add common job titles for better detection
6. ‚úÖ **Negative Features** - Penalize conflicts between fields
7. ‚úÖ **Dedicated Summary Section** - Check for explicit sections first

**Priority 3 (Lower Impact):**
8. ‚úÖ **Profile Section Concept** - Everything before first section
9. ‚úÖ **Bullet Point Detection** - Dedicated handler for descriptions

#### **Our Current vs Open-Resume Approach:**

| Feature | Our Approach | Open-Resume | Better? |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Line Grouping | Simple line-by-line | Char width calculation | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Section Detection | Keyword only | Bold + ALL CAPS | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Field Extraction | Simple regex | Feature scoring | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Name Detection | First non-email line | Scoring (bold, letters only) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Summary Detection | Section keywords | Dedicated section + fallback | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Experience | Section parsing | Subsection division | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Conflict Resolution | First match wins | Negative scoring | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Verdict:** Open-Resume's approach is significantly more sophisticated and accurate!

## üìä DAILY UPDATES

### **October 15, 2025 - Day 1 (60% Complete)**
**Time Started:** 5:51 PM IST  
**Time Updated:** 7:15 PM IST

**Status:** ‚úÖ Analysis Complete - Moving to Integration Planning

**Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Cloned open-resume repository
2. ‚úÖ Analyzed 4-step parsing pipeline
3. ‚úÖ Studied feature scoring system
4. ‚úÖ Reviewed section detection (Bold + ALL CAPS)
5. ‚úÖ Analyzed work experience subsection handling
6. ‚úÖ Documented 9 key techniques to integrate
7. ‚úÖ Created comparison table (our vs their approach)

**Key Discoveries:**
- **Feature Scoring System:** Revolutionary approach - scores each text item with positive/negative features
- **Section Detection:** Bold + ALL CAPS is much better than keyword-only
- **Line Merging:** Calculate typical char width for intelligent merging
- **Subsections:** Divide experience/education into individual entries first

**Next Steps (Tomorrow):**
